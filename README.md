# Gramateria - v1.0.4 
A drag and drop web builder  


Gramateria v1.0.4 is a re-rewritten version that changed many features and code.

> Although I have stopped developing this app for a while, there are still many users and I feel a little bad because of my old/dirty codes. So I decided to refactor the codes and add some features to be more useful for developers and non-developers.


## Installation 

```npm install```

```npm start```

#### Generate sources
```npm run gen```

#### Watch sources
```npm run watch```


##### Build desktop app
```npm run pack```
